            <br />
            <p>
              The Student Instructional Enterprises (SIE)/ Project Manager is a
              member of the faculty and preferably, teaches the technical
              subject related to the SIE. For example, the Poultry Instructor
              also manages the poultry project. This allows him/her to put
              theory into practice. Coordinate with the Practicum Coordinator to
              ensure correct student skills appraisal is carried out.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              On the other hand, an IGP Manager either is a member of the
              faculty or staff or someone who is employed out of the funds
              generated from the IGP, The size, nature and complexity of the
              enterprise will largely determine this. If say it is a 20 ha,
              irrigated land, then the huge workload may necessitate an outside
              manager and workers be employed to run the enterprise.

            <p>
              Since these SIE Instructor In-Charge and IGP Managers are governed

              accordance with proper and sound enterprise management.
